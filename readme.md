0.2x engineer

* 10x-engineer myth
    * exact origin unclear
    * coding challenges from the 60s / 70s where some participants were 10x better than others
        * "Exploratory experimental studies comparing online and offline programming performance", 1968, H. Sackman, W. J. Erikson, E. E. Grant
    * mostly mathematical tasks
    * refuted many times:
        * even if they existed, you couldn't hire them off the street
        * much better to have your 1x devs develop the right thing
* 80% of work in 20% of time
* 80%-solutions are sufficient for 80% of the use cases
* how do we find out which 80% of features to build?
    * do cttcs before development
    * keep iterations short, demand stakeholder feedback
    * ship to end-users as early as possible
    * learn from the past
    * core domain model!
* what about non-functional requirements?
    * question requirements to load, uptime, support etc
    * design for scalabilty
        * in operation (horizontally)
        * in organisation (DDD, allow team landscape to scale)
* how do we chose the right tech stack?
    * KISS
    * use a tech stack that is well-known within the organisation
* how to keep business people from requesting golden faucets?
    * demand sales to participate in dev cycle
        * have them attend reviews, refinements etc
        * demand that they participate in cttcs with actual users
* and how to keep devs from building them anyway?
    * 80/20 time for experiments
    * demand validation of techinal propositions
    * beware of classic anti-patterns: dry, kiss, yagni, nih
    * highly aligned, loosely coupled teams
    * make sure seniors with right mindset have time to mentor juniors
* conclusion
    * build organisation that allows devs to build the right thing
    * involve business ppl in development
    * encourage software craftsmanship

TODO:
* how to hire the right ppl / build 0.2x organisation?
