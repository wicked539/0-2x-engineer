					<section><h2>Hexagonal Architecture</h2></section>
					<section><h3>What is it?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Typical, layered architectures typical provide abstractions "upward" from the domain model used in the database</p>
						<p class="fragment">Hexagonal architecture abstracts not only upward from the database, towards UI, Messaging System, etc as well</p>

						<aside class="notes">
							Layered abstractions around the core domain model & business logic towards UI, DB, Messaging Systems etc.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Promise</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Protect your core domain model against leaking, thus making sure that changes in outer layers can never force you to change the core</p>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Pitfalls</h3>
						<p class="fragment">You end up with tons and tons of interfaces and duplications that constantly change during development, creating a unmaintainable mess</p>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p class="fragment">YAGNI</p>
					</section>

					<section><h2>Reactive Stacks</h2></section>
					<section><h3>What is it?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Non-blocking APIs typically invoke a callback function when their work is done</p>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Promise</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Because threads are no longer blocked waiting for downstream work to continue, we can build very responsive API</p>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Pitfalls</h3>
						<p class="fragment">The programming model is very different from classic, imperative code</p>
						<p class="fragment">The learning curve is very steep, it takes years (!) for a team of old-school java devs to fully embrace non-blocking APIs</p>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p class="fragment">YAGNI</p>
					</section>

					<section><h2>CQRS</h2></section>
					<section><h3>What is it?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Command-query responsibilty segregation essentials means separating the write- and the read-models of your application</p>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Promise</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Applications with an asymmetric read-write load (lots of writes, very little reads) and APIs (read operations require computed outputs) benefit from seperate models</p>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Pitfalls</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Maintaining separate models, along with controller classes, business logic, persistence layers etc, leads to far more complex software projects</p>
					</section>
					<section><h3>Conclusion</h3>
						<p class="fragment">YAGNI</p>
